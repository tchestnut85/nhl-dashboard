## Description

This is an NHL Team Profile dashboard which allows users to view all NHL teams, view a single team's details and roster, and also look at any current player's detailed profile.

This app was made using the React framework Next.js since it allows for easy client-side routing. ChakraUI was also used for making UI components and styling. Axios was used for fetching data from the NHL API. Redux is used for managing the client-side app state.
